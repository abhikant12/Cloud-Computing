## **Security Fundamentals**

### **Basic Components**
- **Confidentiality**: Keep data hidden from unauthorized access.
- **Integrity**: Ensure data is accurate and trustworthy (includes authentication).
- **Availability**: Ensure data and services are accessible when needed.

### **Types of Security Attacks**
1. **Interruption** ‚Äì Attacks availability.
2. **Interception** ‚Äì Attacks confidentiality.
3. **Modification** ‚Äì Attacks integrity.
4. **Fabrication** ‚Äì Attacks authenticity.

### **Threat Classes**
- **Disclosure** (e.g., snooping)
- **Deception** (e.g., spoofing, modification)
- **Disruption** (e.g., DoS)
- **Usurpation** (e.g., spoofing, unauthorized control)

### **Security Goals**
- **Prevention**: Stop violations of policy.
- **Detection**: Identify when violations occur.
- **Recovery**: Contain and fix breaches.

---

## **Security Mechanisms & Models**
- **Policies** define what is allowed.
- **Mechanisms** enforce those policies.
- **Assurance** is achieved via:
  - Specification ‚Üí Design ‚Üí Implementation.

### **Types of Mechanisms**
- **Secure**: All reachable states are secure.
- **Precise**: Matches secure states exactly.
- **Broad**: Covers more than required‚Äîless safe.

---

## **Human & Operational Issues**
- **Cost-Benefit & Risk Analysis**: Weigh security cost vs. potential damage.
- **Legal & Cultural Barriers**: Compliance with local laws/customs.
- **Human Factors**: Insiders, social engineering, responsibility allocation.

## **Network Security Lifecycle**
1. **Policy Formation**
2. **Policy Implementation** (Firewalls, IDS, Honeypots)
3. **Reconnaissance** (Passive vs. Active)
4. **Vulnerability Scanning** (e.g., Nessus, Metasploit)
5. **Penetration Testing**
6. **Post-Attack Forensics**

## **Cloud Security: Key Points from the Paper**

### **1. Research Context**
- **Paper**: ‚ÄúHey, You, Get Off of My Cloud!‚Äù ‚Äì CCS 2009.
- **First work** on **cloud cartography**.
- **Cloud platform**: Amazon EC2.
- Achieved **40% co-residency success** with victim VM.

---

### **2. Cloud Risks**
- **New trust model** between customers & providers.
- **Multi-tenancy risks**: VMs of different users share hardware.
- **Side-channel attacks** possible due to resource sharing.

---

### **3. Multi-tenancy Threats**
- **Cross-VM info leakage**: via CPU cache, memory, disk I/O.
- **VM escape vulnerabilities**: attacker breaks hypervisor isolation.
- **No control** over co-residence.

---

### **4. Attack & Threat Model**
- **Assumes** trusted provider & no software exploits.
- **Attack steps**:
  1. **Placement** ‚Äì place attacker VM on same host.
  2. **Extraction** ‚Äì use side-channels to leak data.
- **Malicious VMs** are regular EC2 instances (max 20/account).
- **Victims**: confidentiality-reliant cloud users.

---

### **5. Research Questions (Q1‚ÄìQ4)**
- **Q1**: Can instance location be discovered? ‚Üí **Yes** (cloud cartography).
- **Q2**: Can co-residency be detected? ‚Üí **Yes**, via network & IP analysis.
- **Q3**: Can attacker get co-resident? ‚Üí **Yes**, via placement techniques.
- **Q4**: Can cross-VM leakage happen? ‚Üí **Yes**, via covert side-channels.

---

### **6. Amazon EC2 Internals**
- **Uses Xen hypervisor** with Dom0 VM.
- **Placement variables**: instance type, region, availability zone.
- Each instance has **internal** (private) & **external** IP.

---

### **7. Cloud Cartography (Q1)**
- Map EC2 using **IP address ranges**.
- Use tools: **nmap**, **hping**, **wget**.
- Match **internal IPs** to identify placement patterns.

---

### **8. Co-residency Detection (Q2)**
- Signs of co-residency:
  - **Same Dom0 IP**
  - **Low ping latency**
  - **Close internal IPs**
- Verified via **disk-based covert channel** (sender modulates disk usage, receiver measures read time).

---

### **9. Causing Co-residence (Q3)**
- **Brute-force approach**: launch many probe VMs ‚Üí ~8.4% co-residency success.
- **Placement locality**: EC2 often places recently started VMs together.
- **Flooding**: launch 20 VMs quickly ‚Üí **40% co-residency** success.

---

### **10. Exploiting Co-residence (Q4)**
- **Cache-based leakage**:
  - Detect computation load.
  - **Traffic analysis**: estimate web traffic via load variation.
  - **Keystroke timing**: infer password typing intervals.

---

### **11. Countermeasures**
- **Mapping**:
  - Randomize IP allocations.
  - Block tools (nmap, traceroute).
- **Co-residency**:
  - Hide Dom0 details.
  - Avoid co-location (hurts cost efficiency).
- **Side-channels**: **No effective solution** currently.

---

### **12. Key Takeaways**
- **Cloud security is weakened** by shared infrastructure.
- **Co-residence is possible** and dangerous.
- **Real-world cloud** (Amazon EC2) was vulnerable.
- **Side-channel attacks** can leak **sensitive data**, even without software bugs.

### üîê **Security Issues in Cloud Computing**
- **Unique challenges**: Co-tenancy, outsourced data/application control loss.
- **Common concerns**: Inadequate policies, insufficient security controls.
- Need for **trust relationships** between customers and cloud vendors.

---

### üåê **SaaS Cloud-based Collaboration**
- **Entities**: Service Consumers (users/apps/orgs), Service Providers (SaaS vendors).
- **Collaboration Types**:
  - **Tightly-coupled** (federated)
  - **Loosely-coupled** (focus area)
- **Issues**:
  - Data integrity risks in shared environments.
  - Existing security/auth mechanisms are limited for loose coupling.

---

### ‚ö†Ô∏è **Motivations & Challenges**
- SaaS cloud = **Maximum lack of control**, limited audit/reporting.
- Cloud SLAs are **inconsistent**; not always trustworthy.
- **Dynamic data sharing** poses **security risks**.
- Main focus: **Select ideal SaaS provider** and **secure loosely-coupled collaborations**.

---

### üéØ **Objectives**
1. **SelCSP**: Framework to select **trustworthy, competent** SaaS providers.
2. Minimize **access risk & uncertainty** when accepting anonymous access requests.
3. Heuristic for **IDRM (Inter-Domain Role Mapping)**: minimize excess permissions.
4. **Distributed secure collaboration framework**: detect/remove access conflicts **locally**.

---

### ‚≠ê **Trust Models in Cloud**
- Most lack **mathematical validation**.
- Based on **QoS + Trust** [Liu‚Äô04, Garg‚Äô13].
- Goal: Model **trust, reputation, competence** of SPs.

---

### üìú **Service Level Agreements (SLA)**
- Mostly guarantee **availability only**.
- Lack standardization in clauses & compensations [Habib‚Äô11].
- **Goal**: Standardize SLA parameters to **reduce risk perception**.

---

### üõ°Ô∏è **Risk-based Access Control (RAC)**
- Grants access even without proper permissions if **risk is acceptable**.
- Better than binary access models.
- **Challenges**:
  - Security uncertainty is **not well-addressed**.
  - Many valid requests **rejected** due to lack of quantified operational need.

---

### ü§ñ **Distributed RAC using Fuzzy Inference**
- Uses **local info** to estimate risk and make access decisions.

---

### üß© **Inter-Domain Role Mapping (IDRM)**
- **Objective**: Map requested permissions to **minimum local roles**.
- **Challenges**:
  - No polynomial solution.
  - Multiple minimal sets may exist.
  - **Variants**: IDRM-safety, IDRM-availability.

---

### üîÅ **Access Policy Conflicts**
- **Types**:
  - **Cyclic Inheritance Conflict**
  - **Separation of Duty (SoD) Constraint Violation**

#### Detection
- **Inheritance Conflict**:
  - Entry role senior to exit role.
- **SoD Violation**:
  - Conflicting permissions between entry/exit roles.

#### Removal
- **Exactly Matched Role**:
  - Use RBAC hybrid hierarchies: I-hierarchy, A-hierarchy, IA-hierarchy.
- **No Match**:
  - Introduce **virtual roles**.
- **SoD Conflict**: Remove conflicting permission if:
  - Same object.
  - Hierarchical access mode relation.

---

### üß† **Summary of Secure SaaS Collaboration**
1. **SelCSP**: Select SaaS provider.
2. **Access Request Recommendation**: Risk-aware, anonymous users.
3. **Permission Mapping**: IDRM.
4. **Conflict Detection & Removal**: Ensure policy consistency across domains.

  - Recommend the best provider.
  - Protect customer interests.

---

## üéØ **Motivation**
- Flexible provider selection.
- Evaluate **trustworthiness** of providers.
- Monitor ongoing service quality.
- Avoid **vendor lock-in** (provider dependency).

---

## ‚úÖ **Objectives**
- Select the **best-fit provider** as per customer QoS.
- Calculate **SLA satisfaction** & **trust level** of provider.
- Enable **dynamic migration** if QoS deteriorates.

---

---

## üß† **Provider Selection (Fuzzy Inference Engine)**
- **Inputs**: QoS values, Trust values.
