## **VM Migration Overview**
VM Migration is the process of moving a running virtual machine (VM) from one physical host to another without disrupting its operation. It involves transferring CPU state, memory, storage, and network connections.

### **Why Migrate VMs?**
- **Load Balancing:** Efficient distribution of VM workloads.
- **System Maintenance:** Perform updates without affecting services.
- **Power Management:** Consolidate VMs to save energy.
- **Quality-of-Service (QoS):** Meet service level agreements.
- **Fault Tolerance:** Avoid downtime in case of failures.
- **Resource Sharing:** Optimize under-utilized resources.

---

## **Types of VM Migration**
1. **Cold (Non-Live) Migration**
   - VM is paused or shut down.
   - Simpler but causes high downtime.
   
2. **Hot (Live) Migration**
   - VM keeps running during migration.
   - Minimal service disruption.

---

## **Live Migration Approaches**

### 1. **Pre-Copy Approach**
- **Phases:**
  - *Pre-Copy:* VM continues to run, memory pages copied iteratively.
  - *Termination:* Based on iteration count, memory copied, or dirty pages threshold.
  - *Stop-and-Copy:* VM paused, remaining dirty pages and CPU state copied.
  - *Restart:* VM resumes on the destination.
- **Used by:** Xen, KVM, VMware.

### 2. **Post-Copy Approach**
- **Steps:**
  - *Stop:* VM paused and CPU state copied.
  - *Restart:* VM starts on destination with empty memory.
  - *On-Demand Copy:* Pages are pulled as needed (demand paging).
- Reduces total data transfer but sensitive to faults during migration.

---

## **Memory Migration Techniques**
- **Push:** Copy pages while VM runs; resend dirtied pages.
- **Stop-and-Copy:** Pause VM, copy all pages, then resume.
- **Pull:** Resume VM on destination; fetch pages on-demand.

---

## **When to Migrate**
- To decommission a server.
- To reduce load on congested servers.

---

## **Migration Considerations**
- **Downtime:** Total unavailability time of services.
- **Migration Time:** Duration to complete VM transfer.
- **Avoid Resource Contention:** During migration, prevent service degradation.

---

## **What Gets Migrated?**
- **CPU Context**
- **Memory**
- **Disk (if not shared via NAS)**
- **Network Config (MAC/IP)**
- **I/O Devices (virtual devices easier)**

---

## **Analysis (Formulas)**

### **Non-Live Migration**
- `Tmig = Vm / R`
- `Tdown = Tmig`

### **Pre-Copy Migration**
- `Ti,mig = (Vm / R) * (1 - r^(n+1)) / (1 - r) + Tres`
- `Ti,down = (r^n) * (Vm / R) + Tres`

Where:
- `Vm`: Memory size of VM  
- `R`: Transmission rate  
- `r`: (P Ã— D)/R; P = page size, D = dirty rate  
- `n`: Iterations  
- `Tres`: Restart time  
- `Vth`: Threshold to stop copying  

---

## **Multiple VM Migrations**

### **Serial Migration**
- VMs migrated one after another.
- Downtime increases due to cascading wait.
- Downtime: `Tsdown = (Vm / R) * r^n + (m - 1) * (Vm / R) * ((1 - r^(n+1)) / (1 - r)) + Tres`

### **Parallel Migration**
- All VMs migrate simultaneously.
- Transmission rate is divided: each gets `R/m`.
- Synchronized stop-and-copy phase.

## âœ… **Container-Based Virtualization (CBV)**  
- **Virtualization**: Sharing of physical resources among multiple users/applications.
- **Containers**: Lightweight, OS-level virtualization; package code + dependencies.
- **Benefit**: Portable, efficient, and fast compared to traditional VMs.

---

## âœ… **Containers â€“ Key Concepts**
- **Virtualize at OS level** (not hardware level like VMs).
- Share **OS kernel**, making them **lightweight and fast**.
- Run anywhere: on-premises, cloud, personal laptops.
- Each container has its **own filesystem, CPU, memory share**, etc.
- Isolated from other apps, yet uses shared host OS.

---

## âœ… **Container Advantages**
- **Portability**: Same behavior across dev, test, and prod environments.
- **Efficiency**: Low overhead, fast startup, optimized resource usage.
- **Isolation**: Clean, secure execution environment.
- **Agility**: Easier deployment, scaling, and testing.
- **DevOps-friendly**: Supports CI/CD pipelines and microservices.

## âœ… **Containers vs. Virtual Machines**
| Feature | Containers | Virtual Machines |
|--------|------------|------------------|
| Virtualize | OS-level | Hardware-level |
| Speed | Fast | Slow (boots full OS) |
| Overhead | Low | High |
| Size | MBs | GBs |
| Isolation | Less than VMs | Strong |
