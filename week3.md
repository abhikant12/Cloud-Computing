| **Aspect**              | **Web Service SLA**                                                                 | **Cloud SLA**                                                                                      |
|------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **QoS Parameters**     | Focus on response time, reliability (SLA violation rate), availability, and cost.   | Includes QoS for **security, privacy, trust, and management**, in addition to performance.         |
| **Automation**         | SLA negotiation, provisioning, monitoring are **mostly manual** or semi-automated. | SLA processes are **highly automated** to support **dynamic and scalable** cloud environments.     |
| **Resource Allocation**| Uses **UDDI** for service discovery and interaction between web services.           | Resources are **dynamically allocated and globally distributed**, **without a central directory**. |

**Summary:**
- **Web Service SLA** deals more with basic service metrics and manual operations.
- **Cloud SLA** encompasses broader concerns (e.g., trust, security) and is designed for dynamic, large-scale systems with automated processes.

### ‚òÅÔ∏è **Cloud SLA vs Web Service SLA**
| Aspect              | Web Service SLA                      | Cloud SLA                              |
|---------------------|--------------------------------------|----------------------------------------|

---

### üßæ **Types of SLA**
- **Non-negotiable (Off-the-shelf)**: Fixed templates by provider
- **Negotiable**: Involves SLA agents for customization

---

### üéØ **Service Level Objectives (SLOs)**
- Measurable QoS targets (e.g., 99.9% uptime, 3-5s response time)

---

### üîç **Service Level Management**
- Ensures services meet defined SLOs
- **Consumer**: Better usage decision  
- **Provider**: Align with business goals

---

### üìå **Key Considerations**
- Business goals
- Provider-consumer responsibilities
- Disaster recovery
- Redundancy
- Data location, seizure, and jurisdiction
- Provider failure

---

### üîê **SLA Requirements**
- Security, encryption, privacy
- Data retention & deletion
- Compliance, certification
- Monitoring & auditability

---

### üìä **Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)**
- Metrics: uptime, downtime, throughput, availability
- KPI ‚ûù SLO mapping (e.g., A = 1 - (downtime / uptime))

---

 

### **SLA Monitoring and Auditing Metrics ‚Äì Short Notes**

- **Throughput**: Speed at which a service responds.
- **Availability**: % of uptime in a defined period (e.g., 99.9% per month).
- **Reliability**: Frequency of service availability (less frequent downtimes = more reliable).
- **Load Balancing**: Triggers elasticity‚Äîauto-scaling up/down of VMs based on load.
- **Durability**: Likelihood that data will be retained without loss (important for storage).
- **Elasticity**: Ability of the system to scale resources up/down as needed.
- **Linearity**: System‚Äôs ability to handle increased load proportionally (performance scales with demand).
- Here‚Äôs a **short note** summarizing the additional **SLA Monitoring and Auditing Metrics** for your **NPTEL exam**:
- **Agility**: Speed at which the provider adjusts resources based on load fluctuations.
- **Automation**: % of requests handled without human involvement (fully automated systems are preferred).
- **Customer Service Response Time**: Time taken by the provider‚Äôs support team to respond to issues.
- **Service-level Violation Rate**: Average rate at which the SLA terms are breached.
- **Transaction Time**: Total time from service invocation to completion, including delays.
- **Resolution Time**: Duration from issue detection to its complete resolution.


---

### üß™ **Examples**
- **Amazon EC2 (IaaS)**: 99.95% uptime
- **Google App Engine (PaaS)**: 99.9% availability
- **Azure, Zoho, Rackspace, Nirvanix**: Varying SLAs based on delivery model

---

### ‚ö†Ô∏è **Limitations**
- Focus on uptime only
- Biased metrics, no active customer monitoring
- No formal SLA compliance check
- Gap between claimed QoS and actual delivery

---

### üì¶ **Expected SLA Parameters**
| Model        | Parameters                                                             |
|--------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **IaaS**      | CPU, storage, VMs, boot time, scale up/down, cost, availability       |

### **Cloud Properties ‚Äì Economic Viewpoint**

#### **Core Attributes**
- **Common Infrastructure**: Shared, standardized resources with cost efficiency from **statistical multiplexing**.
- **Location Independence**: Services available anywhere; **reduced latency**, improved UX.
- **Online Connectivity**: Ensures access; **cost/performance** of networks assessed traditionally.
- **Utility Pricing**: **Pay-per-use**; ideal for variable demand.
- **On-Demand Resources**: Scalable, elastic, with minimal delay/cost of change.

---

### **Economies of Scale**
- **Reduced overhead**, volume-based cost savings.
- **Statistics of Scale**:
  - Built to peak: higher utilization, lower cost per resource.
  - Built below peak: reduces unserved demand, SLA penalties.

---

### **Coefficient of Variation (CV)**
- **CV = œÉ / |Œº|**
- Lower CV = smoother demand curve.
- Aggregating *n* independent demands:  
  - Mean = *nŒº*, Std Dev = ‚àönœÉ ‚Üí CV = **CV/‚àön**
- Aggregation ‚Üí lower penalty (e.g., 100 workloads ‚Üí 10% CV)

---

### **Demand Correlation Effects**
- **Negative correlation**: Better smoothing.
- **Positive (perfect) correlation**: No gain from multiplexing.
- **Simultaneous peaks**: Worst-case.

---

### **Location Independence (Latency Impact)**
- Latency ‚àù distance (fiber: ~124 miles/ms)
- Acceptable UX: response < 100ms (e.g., VOIP < 200ms)

---

### **Utility Pricing**
- **CT = A √ó U √ó B √ó T**,  
  where U = utility premium, A = avg demand
- **BT = P √ó B √ó T**,  
  where P = peak demand
- Cloud cheaper when: **U < P/A**
- Spiky demand ‚Üí **cloud preferred**
- **Hybrid model** = own + rent based on use case

---

### **Penalty of Static Provisioning**
- **Penalty = Œ± √ó ‚à´|D(t) ‚Äì R(t)| dt**
- **Exponential demand**: penalty grows exponentially if R(t) lags.

---

### **Assignment 1: Key Formulae**
- **D(t)**:  
  50 sin(t), for 0 ‚â§ t < œÄ/2  
  20 sin(t), for œÄ/2 ‚â§ t < œÄ  
- **R(t) = D(t) + Œ¥ √ó dD(t)/dt**,  
  with **Œ¥ = œÄ/12**
- **Penalty Cost**:  
  Area under |D(t) ‚Äì R(t)| √ó 0.9 (cost per unit)


---

### **Relational Databases (RDBMS)**

  - Example: Cluster databases (Oracle, SQL Server, DB2)  
- **Shared Disk:**  
  - Servers share storage (NAS/SAN via Ethernet, Fiber Channel, Infiniband)  

**Advantages over RDBMS:**

  - **Sparse, multi-dimensional map** ‚Üí (Row key, Column key, Timestamp)  
  - **Column family:label** format  
  - Multiple versions stored (sorted by timestamp)  
- **Storage Structure:**  
  - Tables split into **tablets** (row ranges)  
  - Tablets managed by **Tablet Servers** using SSTables  
  - Single **Metadata Server** locates tablets  
  - Supports parallel reads/writes  
  - More work than simple appends due to sorted insertion  

---

### **Dynamo (Amazon)**  
- Key-value store for **highly concurrent updates**  
- Not dependent on distributed FS (GFS/HDFS)  
- Data Model: `<Key, Value>`  
  - Uses **MD5 hashing** for key mapping on a **virtual node ring**  
  - Replication across **N** physical nodes  
- **Consistency:**  
  - Quorum-based:  
    - **R** replicas for read  
    - **W** replicas for write  
    - (R + W) > N ‚Üí quorum consistency  
  - Handles versioning via **vector timestamps**  
  - Conflict resolution using app logic  
- Storage engines: **Berkeley DB**, **MySQL**
